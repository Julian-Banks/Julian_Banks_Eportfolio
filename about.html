										<h2><a >RENEWABLE ENGINEER</a></h2>
										<p>An engineer who specialises in renewable energy and <br /> working towards
										a sustainable future for all! <br />
										... at least according to my dad.</p>

								<p>
									Nurtured by my family's encouragement for inventive exploration,
									I embraced the role of a 'tinkerer' from a young age. During my formative years, I sketched elaborate limousines adorned with solar panels, 
									envisioning what I believed could be groundbreaking solar-powered vehicles. This imaginative pursuit was notably influenced by my father,
									a distinguished holder of a PHD in mechanical engineering who, during the early 2000s, was actively engaged in solar and renewable technology
									initiatives. Unfortunately he passed away in my early childhood.   These formative experiences and inspirations have shaped my trajectory as a
									 renewable engineer and left me determined to play a pivotal role in the development of sustainable solutions and a greener future.

									<p>Big smiles as I cross the equator on my motorcycle trip from  Monaco, France to Cape Town, South Africa! <br /> 
										During my gap year in 2019, I managed to earn enough euros on the super yachts in France to buy a bike at the end of my contract. 
										I then set off alone on an epic trip across Europe to Turkey and then down the east coast of Africa until I somehow made it home in one piece.
