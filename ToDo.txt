- Edit and refine ilab entry (would like to spend some time at work cleaning up the files for a git commit?)
- Add some photos of iLab to gallery
- Check for general updates from Student to Graduate
- Edit on website CV, (maybe decide that it's not worth keeping 2 versions up to date and find a pdf embedder)
- Change Professional experience to work and entrueprnerial experience
